### Wireless Weather Sensors
Homey app to read information from wireless weather sensors on 433/868 MHz.

Currently the following protocols are supported on 433 MHz.

* Alecto v1 & v3 (WS-1050/WS-1100/WS-1200)
* Cresta: used in numerous brands 433 MHz sensors, like Cresta & TFA
* La Crosse: only TX3 decoding fully implemented, WS7000 partially (untested)
* Oregon Scientific: version 2 and 3 of the protocol are supported
* UPM/Esic: only tested with WT440H

These types of devices are supported:

* Temperature sensors
* Temperature/humidity sensors
* Anemometers
* Rain gauges
* UV sensors
* Barometers

### Installation
Install the app and go to the app Settings page in Homey. As soon as a sensor signal is picked up, it will show in the list of 'Available sensors'.

Once you see the sensor in the list, you can add it in Homey by pairing it. Select the type of sensor that you want to add (e.g. 'Temperature/Humidity') and a list of available sensors should appear.

Below are some examples of different weather sensor devices in Homey.

A battery alarm will only be shown when the sensor and the protocol support this.

Each sensor also has a static setting page. This will show some (read-only) information about the sensor and e.g. the last date/time data was received from the sensor.

### Settings

On the application settings page a number of selections can be made.

#### Protocols
The first setting determines which protocols need to be enabled. By default they are all enabled, but when some are not needed they can be disabled by the user. Hover over the information button next to the protocol to get some more information on it.

#### Activity

Under the activity settings one can select when a sensor is marked as 'Inactive' in Homey. When no signal is received for the given amount of time, it will be displayed as inactive. As soon as data is received again, the sensor will be marked active and the timer will be reset.

If you want, you can get a notification in the Homey notification sensor when a sensor becomes inactive, active, both or neither.
