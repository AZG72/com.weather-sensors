### Homey app to read information from wireless weather sensors in Athom Homey.

Currently the following protocols are supported on 433 MHz.

* Alecto v3 (WS-1100/WS-1200)
* Cresta: used in numerous brands 433 MHz sensors, like TFA
* La Crosse: only TX3 decoding fully implemented, WS7000 partially (untested)
* Oregon Scientific: version 2 and 3 of the protocol are supported

These types of devices are supported:

* Temperature/humidity sensors
* Anemometers
* Rain gauges
* UV sensors 
* Barometers


Notes:

* This app is not supported.
* Signal reception/Machester pattern recognition in Homey is flakey. Hence a lot of signal transmissions are not received by Homey.
* There is no plan to submit this app in the Athom App Store.
